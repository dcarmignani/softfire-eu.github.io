# SoftFIRE Documentation

This repository contains all the SoftFIRE documentation sources 

## How to generate the documentation html

we are using mkdocs (http://www.mkdocs.org/) so that you can generate html files out of md. 

for generating the site folder with the html files: 
```bash
mkdocs build --clean
```
for seeing the results on a website:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
